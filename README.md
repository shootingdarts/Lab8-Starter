### In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Service workers enables caching of certain webpage data, so when things aren't working properly at the end users they will still see some of the website instead of possibly nothing. This ties into graceful degradation, as the website does not stop working completely when something isn't working.
